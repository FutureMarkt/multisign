# Multisign Wallet

This repository is the open-source code for the Multisign Wallet. The code was developed by the Future Markt team.

Try running some of the following tasks:

# Front-end

We have developed a Front End interface for the wallet. It is located in the front-end folder. The interface is built using the stack: Next.js, Wagmi, Web3.js, and MongoDB.

First, run the development server:

npm i
npx run dev
